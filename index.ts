// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names: string[]=['Muhammad', 'Ali', 'Javaid', 'Ahmed'];

// Loop through each name in the array

for (let name of names) 
{

// print a personalize message for each friend

console.log(`Good morning ${name}, I hope you are having a fantastic day!`)

}
